            <p> If you want a navigation menu for your side column that looks
              like the one on thesitewizard.com, you can generate your own and
              customize it, with the <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/css-menu-buttons.shtml">Navigation
                Menu Wizard</a>. It's free, just like the <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/layout.shtml">Layout
                Wizard</a> that you used to create this. </p>
            <p> And if you want a contact form (ie, one that your visitors can
              use to reach you), go to the <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/feedbackform.shtml">Feedback
                Form Wizard</a> to create one. Yes, it's free too. </p>
            <p> Okay, that's it. I've run out of meaningful things to say for
              this placeholder content, and can't be bothered to think up any
              more stuff that you're just going to delete anyway. </p>
            <p> All the best for your site! </p>
            <p> We did manage to locate a log of the ship's final recording.
              This was presumably recorded before the recording equipment
              malfunctioned. </p>
